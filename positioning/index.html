        In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him
        get around the royal gardens faster...thwo same-size in-line wheels, the
        front one sterrable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The
        device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus the
        device forward in a sort of grinding walk
      </p>
      <p class="second">
        The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was
        made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fed.
        not being practical for transportation in any other place than a wekk
        maintained pathway such as in a park or garden
      </p>
      <p>
        The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when
        pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known
        as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker,"
        since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the
        day made for an extremely uncomfortable roads of the day made for an
        ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academices, similar to
        roller rinks, could be found in large cities.
